The feminist reality is a much more global one, with all the differences in (meaning) interpretations, experiences and disadvantages. Whoever wants to enable feminist and solidary alliances must listen, enable visibility and give up interpretative sovereignty and power. That evening, Tina Adomako will talk to Prof. Akosua Adomako-Amofo, Mariam Claren and Monika Dügle about what alliances could look like and the opportunities offered by overcoming white dominance.",

Based on her own biography and other life stories, she tells how difficult social advancement is, what subtle differences never disappear - and how a new migrant middle class is growing that opposes structural classism and racism and is committed to intersectionality. It shows how society is changing as people who have experienced discrimination and oppression have their say and gain influence.",
